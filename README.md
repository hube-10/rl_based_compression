This is desctiption of the notebooks included: 

Basic concept is demonstrated on the Single layer file. It is where I first tried the concept on copressing a models first layer only. All there other noteboks just add

The one that says ALL LAYERS applies the single layer on all the layers sequentially.
There are also failed attemps included.
